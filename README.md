Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:

"Write something about cats."

Why it's vague:
This prompt is incredibly broad. It doesn't specify the type of "something," the desired length, the tone, or the target audience. The AI could generate anything from a short sentence to a lengthy essay, and it's impossible to predict what it will focus on.

Improved Prompt:

"Write a concise paragraph (approximately 100 words) describing the common personality traits of domestic short-haired cats, suitable for an audience of first-time cat owners."

Why it's more effective:
Clear Subject:
It specifies "domestic short-haired cats," narrowing the topic.
Specific Task:
It asks for a "concise paragraph," not just "something."
Defined Length:
It provides an approximate word count (100 words).
Target Audience:
It specifies "first-time cat owners," which guides the tone and level of detail.
Desired Outcome:
It requests a description of "common personality traits".
In essence:

The improved prompt provides:

Context: It gives the AI a clear understanding of the purpose and audience.
Constraints: It sets limits on the length and scope of the response.
